Facde :
a Facade is a class that provides a static interface to the underlying components in the service container. It offers a convenient way to access Laravel's services without directly interacting with them through dependency injection.

Facades serve as a proxy for underlying classes bound in the service container and provide a clean and expressive syntax for interacting with those classes. They allow you to access various services and features of Laravel in a static way, which can enhance code readability and simplify usage.
we use it when we want 
1-Simplified Syntax
2-Accessing Services Globally
3-Easier Testing
